## Template 2: Interview Tip #1
**Subject:** Interview Tip: The STAR Method 🚀

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

Struggling with behavioral questions? Use the STAR method:

**S** - Situation: Describe the context
**T** - Task: Explain what needed to be done  
**A** - Action: Detail what YOU did
**R** - Result: Share the outcome and what you learned

**Example Question:** "Tell me about a time you faced a challenge at work."

**STAR Answer:**
- *Situation:* "At my last role, our team was behind on a critical project deadline."
- *Task:* "I needed to identify bottlenecks and get us back on track."
- *Action:* "I analyzed our workflow, found redundant approval steps, and implemented a streamlined process."
- *Result:* "We delivered the project 2 days early, saving 40+ hours of work."

**Practice with AI Interview Coach:**
When we launch, our AI will help you practice STAR method answers with instant feedback.

**Pro Tip:** Quantify your results! "Increased sales by 15%" sounds better than "Improved sales."

Stay tuned for more tips next week!

Best,
AI Interview Coach Team

## Template 3: Interview Tip #2  
**Subject:** 3 Common Interview Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them) ❌

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

Most candidates make these 3 mistakes:

**1. Rambling Without Structure**
- **Problem:** Answer goes on for 2+ minutes without clear points
- **Fix:** Use the PREP method: Point, Reason, Example, Point

**2. Not Answering the Question**
- **Problem:** Giving generic answers instead of addressing the specific question
- **Fix:** Pause, rephrase the question, then answer directly

**3. Lack of Enthusiasm**
- **Problem:** Monotone voice, poor eye contact (even on video calls)
- **Fix:** Smile, vary your tone, show genuine interest

**Coming Soon:**
AI Interview Coach will analyze your tone, pace, and clarity to help you avoid these mistakes.

**Launch Update:** We're on track for March 2026 launch. Your 60% discount is still secured!

Best,
