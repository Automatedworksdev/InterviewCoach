**Title:** I built an AI Interview Coach - 24/7 practice with real-time feedback

**Body:**
Hi everyone,

I've been working on an AI Interview Coach that helps job seekers practice interviews 24/7 with instant feedback.

As someone who used to get really nervous in interviews, I wanted to create something that would help others build confidence without paying £100+/hour for human coaches.

**What it does:**
• Asks real interview questions tailored to your role
• Provides feedback on your answers, tone, and confidence
• Gives you a score and areas to improve
• Works for tech, consulting, finance, marketing, etc.

**Demo:** [YOUR_URL] (free waitlist with demo interview)

**Pricing:** £29/month (individual), £99/month (unlimited), £299/month (teams)

Would love your feedback! What interview challenges do you face?
